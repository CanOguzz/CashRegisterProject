# CashRegisterProject
I developed a website that mimics the functions of a cash register

Main functions of the project

*Entering the amount to be given by the user
*Calculating and displaying the amount of change to be given to the user
*Reducing and updating the amount of change used from the cash register every time change is given
*Displaying warning messages in case the amount entered by the user is equal to or less than the price
*Displaying a warning message if there are not enough change in the cash register
